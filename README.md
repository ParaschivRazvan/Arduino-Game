# Arduino-Game
  As the title says, this is a project written in Arduino, which is meant to resemble the old tower defense game : Earth Defender. The purpose of the game is pretty simple. It starts with a shuttle at the bottom of the matrix which can move horizontally and is able to shoot projectiles to the continously spawning meteors. The meteors should not pass you, otherwise they will hit the earth adn will cut out one of your 3 lives. There is a start screen and an end screen. You should shoot as many meteors as you can in order to make a high score. 
  In terms of hardware i have used 3 breadboards, a bunch of wires, an ArduinoUno card, two 100k rezistors, 2 condensers, an analogic joystick, an LCD display(where the score and lives are shown) and, most importantly, the 8x8 Matrix.
